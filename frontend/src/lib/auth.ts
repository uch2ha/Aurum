 * Client-side mirror of the HTTP Basic Auth credentials Aurum's own login
 * screen collects (see components/auth/LoginScreen.tsx), so every fetch can
 * attach `Authorization` itself instead of relying on the browser's own
 * unstyled Basic Auth prompt. nginx's `auth_basic` (see
 * frontend/docker-entrypoint.d/20-basic-auth.sh) is still the actual gate —
 * this only avoids ever triggering that native prompt, by never letting an
 * unauthenticated request happen without us attaching the header ourselves.
 *
 * Two tiers, chosen by the "remember me" checkbox:
 *  - sessionStorage (default): plain, but gone the moment the browser closes.
 *  - the encrypted vault (lib/credentialVault.ts): survives a restart for
 *    REMEMBER_DAYS. It used to be plain localStorage, which meant the
 *    instance password sat on disk recoverable with a single atob() — the
 *    vault encrypts it under a key the browser refuses to hand back.
 *
 * The vault needs a secure context, so on plain HTTP to anything but
 * localhost the remember tier is simply unavailable (isRememberSupported()) —
 * the login screen hides the checkbox rather than silently not remembering.
