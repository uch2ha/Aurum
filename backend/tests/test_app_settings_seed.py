"""Regression coverage for seed_default_app_settings() respecting
AURUM_DEFAULT_CURRENCY. An earlier version of the 9f3a2d7c5e11 migration
hardcoded the singleton app_settings row to currency='USD' at migration
time — since this function only creates the row when it's missing, that
pre-existing row silently defeated a non-USD AURUM_DEFAULT_CURRENCY on a
fresh install. The migration no longer inserts the row at all; this
function is now the sole place it gets created.
