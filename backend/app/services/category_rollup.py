"""Spend/income per top-level category, split-aware — shared by
dashboard_service's breakdown and reports_service's category ranking, the
two places that both roll a subcategory's amount up into its parent
(coalesce(parent_id, id)) and now also need a category's share of a split
transaction counted the same way a plain transaction's is.

A split transaction has Transaction.category_id=NULL (see
models/transaction.py's TransactionSplit) — a query that only joins on that
column would silently drop its spending from every category it actually
touches. This walks both sources (a transaction's own category_id, and its
splits' category_ids) and combines them before rolling up, so a category
funded partly by plain transactions and partly by split lines still shows
one correct total.
