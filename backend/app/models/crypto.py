"""Crypto holdings: a thin layer on top of the existing Asset/AssetValuation
engine (see models/asset.py) rather than a parallel system. Net worth's
number for a holding still lives as ordinary AssetValuation rows, kept
current by services/crypto_service.py — Net Worth requires zero changes to
treat a crypto holding like any other manually tracked asset.

Quantity and average buy price are NOT stored — they're computed from the
CryptoTransaction log (same "you record it, we derive it" shape as
Goal/GoalContribution), because a sell doesn't just subtract quantity, it
also has to leave the average cost basis of what's still held unchanged
(see services/crypto_service.py's _compute_position).

Every holding also belongs to a CryptoPortfolio (below) — a user-defined
group like "long-term" or "memes" — so the same coin can be tracked
separately in more than one portfolio (each as its own CryptoHolding row,
since coingecko_id is deliberately not unique).
